# 📦 discordBot[0] - Custom Prefix

## ✨ About

**djs-customPrefix** is a tutorial repo that I will start creating starting from today, and the first tutorial that I have decided to go with is customPrefixes, basically different prefix per server. They also can customize their own prefix if they want to. As of now, it will be in 1 file under `index.js`, soon I will add a command handler in the next repo.
